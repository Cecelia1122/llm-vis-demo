# llm-vis-project
A live demo inspired by research at the Institute of Visual Computing. This project explores how to reliably generate data visualizations from natural language. It uses a JSON schema to constrain an LLM's output and includes fallback logic to ensure a robust, human-in-the-loop experience, even when the AI is inconsistent.
